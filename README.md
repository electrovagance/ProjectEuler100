# ProjectEuler100
#### A collection of my solutions


## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a [website](https://projecteuler.net/) created back in 2001. It hosts a collection of around 600 different algorithm problems that get progressively harder.  


## Where are the challenges?
You can go to the official [website](https://projecteuler.net/) or head to [freeCodeCamp's collection of challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/) (recommended since it includes tests).


## Rules of the Challenge
1. Announcing that you are committing to the #ProjectEuler100 challenge.
2. Collect the solutions in a repository.
3. Each time a challenge gets completed, add your solution to the GitHub repository and tweet a link to it using the #ProjectEuler100 hashtag.
4. Give supportive feedback on at least 2 tweets from other developers each time you finish a challenge.
5. Complete the next challenge. **Skipping is not allowed.** You can use a programming language of your choice.
6. Upon completion, post a selfie with the repository in celebration!
